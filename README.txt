Description:
The goal of this project was to incorporate a feature found only on mobile devices onto
a laptop. The function of this code is to work with the Linux side's MonkMakes kit in
order to make code that adjusts the laptop screen brightness according to the given light
levels outputted by the MonkMakes' phototransistor. 

Download:
Download the attached code and circuit images provided as the circuit you will need for 
the code to work is made using MonkMakes kit and is arranged as seen in the image attached.

Use:
Run the code and everything will be done by itself. The light sensor found on the breadboard 
will measure the ambient light intensity and will "echo" a command to command prompt which will
change the screen brightness acordingly.

Technology:
RaspberryPi 4, Ethernet Cable, MonkMakes kit
